  <font size="4"> <p>Healthy Grid is a web application which will provide healthy food options to its customers. With the rise in lifestyle diseases, people are now keen to say goodbye to their fast food days and seek healthier options. Also due to their busy schedule, people are not left with the time or energy to cook healthy meals at home. It also becomes difficult for the majority of the students who stay in PGs, hostels, flats, where they donâ€™t have a proper facility to cook due to which they adopt an unhealthy diet.</p></font></b>
